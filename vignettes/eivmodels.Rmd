The goal of EIVmodels is to fit models accounting for measurement error. 

## Setup

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(EIVmodels)
```

## Example 

This package provides options to simulate data from different types of models where there is measurement error in both the `x` and `y` variable. We'll start by simulating some data from a linear regression model. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dat <- sim_reg(n_sim = 10,
               alpha = 0,
               beta = 1,
               x_err = 0.1)
dat
```

Next we'll plot the simulated data and we'll add the true regression line to the plot by adding the argument `add_truth = TRUE` to the `plot_dat()` function. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot_dat(dat,
         add_truth = TRUE)
```
